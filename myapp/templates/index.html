    It will allow you to create new projects, assign tasks to it, set tasks as done or delete them.</p>
<p>In this project youÂ´ll be able to see project structure, models and databases, parameters,
    templates, template inheritance, jinja loops and conditionals, forms,
    url naming, render and redirect, and the use of widgets and static files.</p>
